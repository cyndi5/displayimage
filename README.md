## Requirements

Python 3.11 (It should work on later Python 3 versions; it may work on earlier Python 3 versions as well.)

## Installation

I changed to the directory in which I cloned this repository then ran the following commands to create a virtual environment within this directory, activate it, and install the required PyPi packages.
```
% python3 -m venv venv
% source venv/bin/activate
% pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Running the Program

```
% python displayimage.py --file IMG_3561b.jpg
```

## Uninstall

Again I changed into the directory in which this repository sits. The only thing I needed to do to "uninstall" the app was to deactivate the python virtual environment
```
(venv) cyndi@cyndis-mbp displayimage % deactivate
```
